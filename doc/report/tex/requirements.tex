\section{Requirements} % (fold)
\label{sec:requirements}
The requirements were gathered and divided using the MoSCoW method, resulting
in four sections: `must have', `should have', `could have' and `won't die'. The
requirements tables show the before and after affect of the user testing.

\subsection{Before User Testing} % (fold)

\subsection{After Using Testing} % (fold)
The following tables outline the changes made to requirements after user
testing. \emph{Emphasised} text indicates a new or altered requirement, while
\textbf{bold} text indicates that this requirement was implemented in the high
fidelity prototype.

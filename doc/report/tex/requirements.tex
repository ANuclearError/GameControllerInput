\section{Requirements} % (fold)
\label{sec:requirements}
The requirements were gathered and divided using the MoSCoW method, resulting
in four sections: `must have', `should have', `could have' and `won't die'. The
requirements tables show the before and after affect of the user testing.

 \hline
 Keyboard display & The on-screen keyboard must display a grid of selectable
 characters, acting as the keyboard. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Cursor display & The area of characters that the user is able to select from
 must be highlighted to the user, to allow them to see the position of the
 cursor in the keyboard. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Input Display & The display must show the text the user has already input, as
 well as the caret showing where text is being input. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Alphabet & The keyboard must also for the selection of alphanumeric characters,
 with additional punctuation marks to round the total number available. &
 Functional \\
 \hline
 Spacing & The user must have a way to add a space to the text they are
 entering. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Movement & The user must be able to move the cursor, using the left control
 stick. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Backspacing & The user must have a way to backspace when they wish to change
 the text. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Selection & The user must be able to select from the grid of characters, using
 the right control stick. Where the user moves the stick determines which
 character is selected. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Move caret & The caret is the flashing flashing horizontal line indicating
 where text being input by the user will be placed. The user must be able to use
 the triggers to move the caret left or right, changing where text is being 
 input. & Functional \\
 \hline
 Switch case & The user must be able to switch between upper and lower case.
 & Functional \\
 \hline

 options button. & Functional \\

 characters in the Latin Alphabet, for languages such as French. & Functional \\

\subsection{After Using Testing} % (fold)
The following tables outline the changes made to requirements after user
testing. \emph{Emphasised} text indicates a new or altered requirement, while
\textbf{bold} text indicates that this requirement was implemented in the high
fidelity prototype. If the proposed keyboard system were to be fully developed
for a games console, then all the `must have' requirements would be necessary,
but since the prototype was focused on the character method aspect of the
input, it was felt that a particular focus was required for the prototype.

In addition to the user contributions, an expansion was made with regards to
non-functional requirements.

 feedback if it is misspelt. & Functional \\

 \textbf{\emph{Smaller Matrix}} & The selection matrix should be 2x2 rather than
 3x3, due to concerns that 8 way movement with the control stick could result
 in increased errors. & Functional \\
 \hline
 \emph{Resources} & The system should have minimal use of resources, requiring
 little memory or processing time. & Non-functional \\
 \hline
 \emph{Maintainability} & The keyboard design should be maintainable to allow
 for easier modification, to allow for example, a larger grid or different
 alphabets. & Non-functional \\
 \hline
 \emph{Reliability} & The movement of the right control stick for character
 selection should be reliable so that the user's desired character matches their
 movement, without being askew. & Non-functional \\
 \hline
 \emph{Data Integrity} & The system should ensure that the input being provided
 by the user is correct, and remains the same unless the user has specifically
 performed an action. & Non-functional \\
